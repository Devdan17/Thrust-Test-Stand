# Thrust-Test-Stand
## Overview

Welcome to the Thrust Test Stand repository! This project is dedicated to the precise evaluation of BLDC motor performance by measuring two critical parameters: RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) and thrust. The software provided here serves as a powerful tool for interfacing with testing equipment and gathering essential data for comprehensive performance analysis.

## Key Features

- **RPM Testing:** Use our software to assess the RPM of your device accurately. It's a valuable tool for evaluating the rotational speed of motors.

- **Thrust Measurement:** Determine the thrust generated by your device with precision. This capability is crucial for applications like aviation, robotics, and propulsion systems.

- **Graph Plotting:** Visualize your data with ease. The software allows you to plot insightful graphs for Thrust vs. Throttle and RPM vs. Throttle, providing a clear understanding of your device's performance characteristics.

- **Data Storage:** Save your collected data and graphs for future reference. The software supports data storage, ensuring you can revisit and analyze your test results at any time.

## Software Requirements

- **Arduino IDE:** Since we using arduino as our microcontroller to give commands to the components , the arduino code must be written in the IDE and then upload it.

- **Visual Studio Code:** This is the basic platform , where our entire GUI python code is run on.

## Libraries used

- **HX711_ADC.h:** This is a library used in the arduino code which contains the HX711 amplifier module calibration code which allows us to find the Thrust of the motor using the help of a Load Cell.

- **EEPROM.h:** This is another library used in the arduino code that allows us to read and write data to/from the EEPROM, which is present in the arduino , the main purpose od this is to read the value of Thrust of any given motor.

- **Servo.h:** This library allows us to access all the code and calibration related to servo motors , the purpose of this in our project is to to create a servo object to control our ESC.
