# Thrust-Test-Stand
## Overview

Welcome to the Thrust Test Stand repository! This project is dedicated to the precise evaluation of BLDC motor performance by measuring two critical parameters: RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) and thrust. The software provided here serves as a powerful tool for interfacing with testing equipment and gathering essential data for comprehensive performance analysis.

## Key Features

- **RPM Testing:** Use our software to assess the RPM of your device accurately. It's a valuable tool for evaluating the rotational speed of motors.

- **Thrust Measurement:** Determine the thrust generated by your device with precision. This capability is crucial for applications like aviation, robotics, and propulsion systems.

- **Graph Plotting:** Visualize your data with ease. The software allows you to plot insightful graphs for Thrust vs. Throttle and RPM vs. Throttle, providing a clear understanding of your device's performance characteristics.

- **Data Storage:** Save your collected data and graphs for future reference. The software supports data storage, ensuring you can revisit and analyze your test results at any time.

 ## Coding platforms used

- **Arduino IDE:** This is used to write down the code/instructions for the arduino to follow.

- **VS Code:** This platform is used for typing and executing the python code for The GUI of the project.

## Libraries used

-**HX711_ADC.h** This package helps in converting the analog value output of load cell into digital value and sending the input to the arduino.

-**Servo.h** This package helps in controlling the BLDC motor.

-**EEPROM.h** This package helps in storing and retrieving data sent and received frrom Load cell and its stored in arduino.
